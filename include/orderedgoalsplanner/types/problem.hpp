 * @brief The problem is the part of the planification that describes the current state.<br/>
 * It is composed of 3 parts:<br/>
 *  * Goals of the bot<br/>
 *  * Current state of the world.<br/>
 *  * History of actions done. It is useful because some actions should not be repeated.<br/>
 *  <br/>
 *  The other part of the planification is the domain. The domain describes how the word can be modified.<br/>
 *  Contrary to the problem, the domain does not change a lot usually.
